This one is just beautiful.\r\n\r\nA British pianist, living in Thailand, has taken his craft to entirely new heights.\r\n\r\nSomewhere, deep in the jungle, 57-year-old Paul Barton has dragged his piano into a clearing, on the banks of the River Kwai, to play music for old, injured and disabled elephants.\r\n\r\nThe self-taught pianist met his larger than life audience during a visit to an elephant sanctuary with his wife in 2011.\r\n\r\n“I wondered if these old elephants might like to listen to some slow classical music when I arrived, so I asked if I could bring my piano along and they allowed it,” Mr Barton said.\r\n\r\nRoping in a bunch of mates to help him load his upright piano onto the back of a ute, Mr Barton drove it up the mountain and into the middle of the Elephants World sanctuary.\r\n\r\n\r\nUntethered and free to wander and graze as they please, elephants would surround Mr Barton and his piano during each visit, fascinated by the calming sounds of Beethoven, Mozart, Bach and Debussy.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Barton uploads videos of his jungle concerts to his YouTube channel, showing baby elephants who squeak and bark along to the music, and older elephants that flap their ears and sway as the he plays.\r\n\r\n“It’s said elephants memorise your scent and will think of you as a friend the next time you’re together,” he said.\r\n\r\n“When I play music to elephants I always feel calm and happy.”\r\n\r\nMr Barton will calm the elephants, welcoming him to his piano before sitting down to play for them.
